## 1 - Supervised Learning module

In this module's project, several supervised algorithms are employed to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The algorithms are freely chosen by the student to be better fitted to the presented task. The best candidate algorithm from preliminary results is taken to further optimize it to best model the data. The goal of this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than  $50,000. This sort of assignment can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out, to begin with.

## 2 - Unsupervised Learning module

In this project, a dataset is analyzed containing information from various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
